if u want to train it with ur own dataset!

just paste your dataset file in the curent directory and also make sure to change the pre-written dataset file name in the code {line 16}

then edit the data[_,_] according to ur dataset!! {line 17}

and accordingly , u'll need to modify the code with ur dataset 





## If u want to verify if the model learns from my file or not... just uncomment the last two lines of the code and run the code
u'll then get the results as spam or not_spam

## Note - U can modify the examples to check if it works or not!!
